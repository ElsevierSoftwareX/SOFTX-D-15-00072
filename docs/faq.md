# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can you help me query the NCBI servers?
A: Providing a complete guide on how to query the NCBI servers is well beyond the scope of this short FAQ. However, this query works just as the one on [the Entrez web portal](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery). The full documentation on how to query the entrez database can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3837/#_EntrezHelp_Entrez_Searching_Options_).
