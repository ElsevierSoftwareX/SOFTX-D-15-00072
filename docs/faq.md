# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can you help me query the NCBI servers?
A: Providing a complete guide on how to query the NCBI servers is well beyond the scope of this short FAQ. However, this query works just as the one on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery (the Entrez web portal). A guide for this information can be found in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3837/#_EntrezHelp_Entrez_Searching_Options_.
