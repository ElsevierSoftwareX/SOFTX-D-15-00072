## Future plans:
* For now the *FASTA* format is hard-coded in the program, but this may change should there be demand for it;
    * This effectively limits *NCBI Mass Sequence Downloader* to **sequence** databases.
* As more NCBI sequence databases become available, they will be added to *NCBI Mass Sequence Downloader*.
* Add more online help topics, as suggested in issue [#1](https://github.com/StuntsPT/NCBI_Mass_Downloader/issues/1).
