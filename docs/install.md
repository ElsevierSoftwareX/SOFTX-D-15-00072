# Installation
There are essentially three ways to install *NCBI Mass Sequence Downloader*:

1. Get the [latest release](https://github.com/StuntsPT/NCBI_Mass_Downloader/releases/latest) binaries.
    * Just uncompress the file for your OS anywhere you like, and double click the executable file. Everything is wrapped up and ready to go.
2. Get the latest source code [release](https://github.com/StuntsPT/NCBI_Mass_Downloader/releases/latest).
    * This requires python (2 or 3) for the CLI version. [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) is further required for the GUI version.
    * Just uncompress the tarball (`tar xvfJ NCBI_Mass_Sequence_Downloader_Linux_x86_64-vX.X.tar.xz` where X.X is the version number) into any directory you like, `cd` into the newly created directory and run the program as described in the [usage](usage.md) and [testing](testing.md) sections.
3. To get the current development version, you must clone the git repository.
    * This requires that you have "git" installed in your machine.
    * Clone the repository like this: `git clone https://github.com/StuntsPT/NCBI_Mass_Downloader.git`
    * Afterwards, do `cd NCBI_Mass_Downloader` and run the program as described in the [usage](usage.md) and [testing](testing.md) sections.
